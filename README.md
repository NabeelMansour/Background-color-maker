# Background-color-maker project using html/css and javascript. The project is a follow along tutorial by John Smilga to use the dom manipulation. I feel it is a great project to escape the tutorial hell that I exprience at the moment, but this is  the beginning to make hands on projects and I'am so exiting. 

Here is a link to the project:
